# Dan's PopClip Extensions

My small collection of [PopClip](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) extensions.

## Installation

This repository only includes these as source bundles (.popclipext), not packaged .popclipextz versions. To install, just make sure the extension of a folder is .popclipext and double click it in Finder.

### ManyChat

Open the ManyChat Live Chat URL for a given subscriber ID.

When installing, it will prompt for the ManyChat Account ID. This is the string beginning with "fb" in the ManyChat URL of your account, e.g. fb555555555555555.
